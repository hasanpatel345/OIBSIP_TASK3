Sales Prediction using Python: 
I created a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data. 
This project involved working with time series data, feature engineering, and using algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees. 
It was exciting to predict future sales trends and see the practical application of predictive analytics in business decision-making.
